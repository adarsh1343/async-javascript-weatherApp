# Weather App
GDSC's Fall 23's Workshop Project to learn Async JavaScript.

## Final Project:
![weatherApp](https://github.com/USFGDSC/async-javascript/assets/98829238/221eed6d-0c3e-490c-ba34-265ae0f1ae4b)

## Technologies used:
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Note:
- The link for this web application (https://adarsh1343.github.io/async-javascript-weatherApp/) runs an HTTPS protocol, which is causing some issues with the use of APIs. This issue will be resolved shortly.
